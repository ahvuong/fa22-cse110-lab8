1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.  

   - Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed  
   The automated tests in the Recipe project development pipline would fit in Github Action because github action can automate all software workflows with Continuos integration CI that can help stick to quality standards by running tests and reporting the results on Github.  
2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
   - Yes.  
3. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.  
   - Yes, I can test by sending the message and checking if it's sent correctly or not.  
4. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.  
   - Yes, I would use a unit test to test the max message length because I can check the message that its long is under 80 characters or not.
